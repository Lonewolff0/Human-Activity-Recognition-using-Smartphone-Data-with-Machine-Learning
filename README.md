# DATA PREPROCESSING:
Use StandardScaler library for data prepocessing.
# MODEL:
We can use many models like logistic regression classifier or KNeighborsClassifier or RandomForestClassifier or DecisionTree et...All these models give almost same accuracy.
I used RandomForsetClassifier.I have droped subject column because it has less effect in prediction the activity
